Make 'Auto1' run through the entire course work from labeling the grond truth, to using Viola Jones to using VJ+HT and in the end creating a graph to compare the TP, FP FN and f1 scores of each method per image. 

Make it as interactive as possible. 

if multiple images, label all the ground truths initially and don't plot the images using if conditions

if single image then plot the images of the itemediary stages using if conditions. a bool for multiple.
