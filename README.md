# IPCV Coursework: The Dartboard Challenge
Details of the work done for this project is detailed in **COMS30121_Report.pdf** and below is a summary of the code structure

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Subtask 1: The Viola-Jones Object Detector
#### Both the Jupyter Notebook and the python file contain the same code, however, the Jupyter Notebook has some minor annotations.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Subtask 2: Building and Testing your own Detector
#### Similarly, both the Jupyter Notebook and the python file contain the same code, however, the Jupyter Notebook has some minor annotations.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Subtask 3: Integration with Shape Detectors
#### The main code is in Q3.py which runs iteratively on all the images, re-producing the results. This takes upto 50 minutes. There are 2 Jupyter Notebooks, 1 is a demo which runs the code on 1 iteration, showing the intemediary steps, the other was used to produce some graphs for the report
------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Subtask 4: Improving your Detector
#### we have edited the library slightly for this stage and so made a new one called libraryQ4.py which Q4.py loads from. Q4 runs iteratively through all images, it's very similar to Q3, just with different parameters.
#### We have also included our code for running SSD in SSD.py courtesy of superdatascience online deep learning course.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
### LOADING IMAGES:
#### For iterative testing, place all test images in a folder and load that path directory when prompted. 
#### For single testing, same as above, however you will need to specify the image name when prompted.
