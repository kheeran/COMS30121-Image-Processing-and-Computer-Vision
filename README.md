### Subtask 1: The Viola-Jones Object Detector
#### Both the Jupyter Notebook and the python file contain the same code, however, the Jupyter Notebook has some minor annotations.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Subtask 2: Building and Testing your own Detector
#### Similarly, both the Jupyter Notebook and the python file contain the same code, however, the Jupyter Notebook has some minor annotations.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Subtask 3: Integration with Shape Detectors
#### The main code is in Q3.py which runs iteratively on all the images, re-producing the results. This takes upto 50 minutes. There are 2 Jupyter Notebooks, 1 is a demo which runs the code on 1 iteration, showing the intemediary steps, the other was used to produce some graphs for the report
